An on-the-fly music creation app for Android. This is a personal project. There is a glaring problem with this implementation because it introduces unnecessary overhead due to real-time communication between the frontend written in Kotlin and the audio engine written in C++. If it was any other type of software, this would not be a problem, but low latency is one of the most important requirements for a real-time audio manipulation. Future development will happen in the form of a full C++ rewrite to an "influx3" repo whenever I get the time.
