An on-the-fly music creation app for Android. This is a personal project. There is a glaring problem with this implementation because it introduces unnecessary overhead due to real-time communication between the frontend written in Kotlin and the audio engine written in C++. Future development will happen in the form of a full C++ rewrite to an "influx3" repo whenever I get the time.
